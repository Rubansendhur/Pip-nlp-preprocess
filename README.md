# Pip-nlp-preprocess
# NLP Preprocess Toolkit Utils

`nlp_preprocess_toolkit_utils` is a simple and efficient Python package designed to streamline the preprocessing of text data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. This package offers a variety of text preprocessing functions, such as text normalization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and word cloud generation. It can handle a wide range of input formats, including text files, CSV files, Excel files, and even URLs.

This package is designed to help you quickly prepare text data for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling by providing essential preprocessing steps in an easy-to-use toolkit.

## Features

- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.)
  - Tokenization using NLTK
  - Stopword removal (with support for custom stopword lists)
  - Lemmatization using WordNet
  - URL and special character removal

- **Input Handling:**
  - Read and preprocess text from plain text files (`.txt`), CSV files, and Excel files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`).
  - Fetch and preprocess text directly from URLs.
  - Supports NLTK corpora for seamless preprocessing of corpora data.

- **Word Cloud Generation:**
  - Generate word clouds from preprocessed text data with customizable options.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install nlp_preprocess_toolkit_utils
